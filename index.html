            Use your discrimination as a dealer of fine gems to buy a package that matches the price your buyer is looking to spend.
          </p>

          <p>
            You will be given a random number representing the buyer's offer at the beginning of the game.
          </p>

          <p>
            The four types of gems will each have a hidden value until you decide to buy one.  Click on an image to buy a gem of that type and add it's value to your inventory. Keep buying until the value of your inventory matches the buyer's offer, but be careful about how much you are spending.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you go over the buyer's offer he will walk away from the deal, but if you can provide an inventory with a value that matches his offer exactly, you will walk away with a tidy profit.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether you make a deal or are left holding the bag, you can continue on to the next buyer in search of a new deal, but when you do, the buyer's offer and the prices for each type of crystal will be reset.
          </p>
          <p>
            Good luck, and happy gem dealing.
          </p>
