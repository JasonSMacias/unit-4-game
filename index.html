        <p class="lead">Use your discrimination as a collector of fine specimens of crystal to acquire a package of crystals to match the value your buyer is willing to spend.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>Match his offered value exactly, or lose the deal.</a>

    <section class="instructions">
      <p>You will be given a random number representing the buyer's offer at the beginning of the game.</p>
      <p>The four types of crystals below will have a hidden value until you decide to buy one.</p>
      <p>Click on an image to buy  a crystal of that type and add it to your inventory. Keep buying until you meet the buyer's offer, but take carful note of how much you are spending.</p>
      <p>If you overshoot the buyer's offer, he will walk away from the deal, leaving you in the cold, but if you can provide an inventory that matches his offer exactly, you can walk away with a tidy profit.</p>
      <p>Whether you make a deal or get left holding the bag, you can continue on to the next buyer in search of a new deal, but when you do, the buyer's offer and the prices for each type of crystal will be reset.</p>
